# let and const for block scoped variables

- ### Block scope are scope of variables within a pair of curly braces {}.

- ### JavaScript only had function scopes and global scope before ES6.

- ### Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within its scope.

### `Let` declarations are not hoisted. 
### Hoisting is moving functions and variable declarations to the top of their scope.

### `const` allows declaring of  variables that are block scoped but are read-only.
### However, they must be initialized, unlike `let`.
