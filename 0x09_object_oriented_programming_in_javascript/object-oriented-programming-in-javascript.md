<h1>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h1>

### It is based on the concept of objects, which bundle data and behaviors together.

- ### *It promotes code reusability, modularity, and scalability.*

## Key principles of Object-Oriented Programming
- ### Encapsulation: *bundling data and methods into a single unit.*

- ### Abstraction: *hiding implementation details and exposing only what is necessary.* 

- ### Inheritance: *creating new objects based on existing ones.* 

- ### Polymorphism: *objects can share the same method name but behave differently.*
